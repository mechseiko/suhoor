FIREBASE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

1. Create a Firebase Project
----------------------------
1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add project" or "Create a project".
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "suhoor-app").
4. Follow the setup steps (you can disable Google Analytics for this project to keep it simple).
5. Click "Create project".

2. Enable Firebase Services
---------------------------
You need to enable Authentication and Firestore Database for this app to work.

A. Authentication:
   1. In your project dashboard, click "Build" > "Authentication" in the left sidebar.
   2. Click "Get started".
   3. Select "Email/Password" from the Sign-in method list.
   4. Enable the "Email/Password" switch.
   5. Click "Save".

B. Firestore Database:
   1. Click "Build" > "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar.
   2. Click "Create database".
   3. Choose a location (e.g., nam5 (us-central)).
   4. Start in **Test mode** (for development) or **Production mode**.
      - If you choose Test mode, anyone can read/write to your database for 30 days.
      - If you choose Production mode, you'll need to update the rules later.
   5. Click "Create".

3. Get Your Environment Variables
---------------------------------
1. In your project dashboard, click the **Gear icon** (Settings) next to "Project Overview" in the top left.
2. Select "Project settings".
3. Scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
4. Click the **</> (Web)** icon to create a new web app.
5. Enter an app nickname (e.g., "Suhoor Web").
6. (Optional) Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" if you plan to deploy it later.
7. Click "Register app".
8. You will see a code snippet with `firebaseConfig`. You need the values from this object.

4. Configure Your Local Environment
-----------------------------------
1. In your project root folder (`c:\Users\abdul\Desktop\Dev.Seiko\suhoor`), create a file named `.env` (if it doesn't exist).
2. Copy the keys from the Firebase console and paste them into `.env` following this format:

   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

   *Note: Do not use quotes around the values.*

5. Database Schema (Automatic)
------------------------------
You DO NOT need to manually create tables or collections. The application will automatically create them when you use it.

The app uses the following structure (NoSQL):
- **profiles**: Stores user details (email, display name). Created when you log in/sign up.
- **groups**: Stores group details. Created when you click "Create Group".
- **group_members**: Links users to groups. Created when you create or join a group.

6. Firebase CLI (Optional but Recommended)
------------------------------------------
If you want to deploy your app or manage it from the command line:
1. Install Firebase tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Initialize: `firebase init`
   - Select **Firestore** and **Hosting**.
   - Select "Use an existing project" and choose the one you created above.
   - For Firestore rules, press Enter to accept defaults.
   - For Hosting:
     - Public directory: `dist`
     - Configure as a single-page app? **Yes**
     - Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? **No** (unless you want to)

That's it! Once your `.env` file is set up, you can run `npm run dev` to start the app.
