1. Group details page and wake up flow for Native Capacitor app
    join or create groups using unique keys. Within a group, you can monitor the status of members, 
    see live locations during wake up windows (15 minutes before Suhoor), and manually "Buzz" members 
    who are still sleeping.' ,
2. Make sure the native app works on both android and Ios, whaever way possible(i.e mkae sure the APK is
    able to be downloaded on ios)

//Implemented


1. in the capacitor app:

every member of everyy group that has choosen to fast that day or that didnt say no(which defaults to yes) gets buzzed(in-app alarm) 15 MINUTES To the time for suhoor fetched from the API

but let each user be able to set the time they want to wake up int he fasting times page(the page we are fetching the api from) so each group memeber sees the time each other want to wake up
they see which members have clicked the im a wake button and those that have not(and they can trigger the buzz on the phone or app of those that are not)

so he who does not update the fasting time(suhoor time) fecthed from the api in his fasting page(let it default to the time from the api of course)

when they click the im  awake button they will be required to type the date for that day in full i.e 01-13-2026 will type 0 1 1 3 20 2 5 before we can accept that hes awake and his status will change and other members wont need to disturb or ake him up to know they are not feeling sleepy and they wont sleep again

of course i know my buzz wil sound again after 5 minutes

adittionally 
then he who wakes up is being stored in the db of course to fecth in the dashboard grapghs and others

2. check the verify-email flow, no need to verify email on signinug up or logining from anywhere please
they can do that in the profile page

3. check the capacitor app flow, will it work once i open the app on my phone now, willl i be able to download the appp


write the docs page in full
with navbar
and put it in my header and footer links

let it onatin how to installl the aopp, introduction, how to navigate and explain each oages in the dahsboard

//Implemented

1. The insights asdmin page should be removed completely, the details ablout the consistentcy of eacxg group should be shown when i enter  agroup whether to virew oyur details, memebers or to wake someone up

2. I shouldnnt set if ill fast romorrow in any groups page, the one in the dashboard is okay, make sure that one works anyways

3. Members, after joining should be able to leave the group after joining

4. THE ADMIN OF THE GROUP SHOULD HAVE AN OPtion to remove a memeber from a group

5. i think because of our local stroage cahcing
my fasting times isnt changing on the next day, check that


6. i think aalso wheni deploy , the changes sont shw until i delete my browing data, maybe bevause of caching also

7. when i click on install apk in my lander i only get directed to the top of my lander

//Implemented

1.  Wake up flow for suhoor:

    A day before, a person is propmted on the group pageeeee if they would like to fast tomorrow or not
    if yes: it will show to all group memebers that this person wants to fast tomorrowIf not: it will show to all group memebersbers of  agroup
    that this person does not want to fast tomorrow
    If a person doesn't say anything about this, i.e say if they want to fast tomorrow or not(it will automatically
    set to true on the database, subsequently, all this fasts that theya re fasting will bw stored on the db,
    and used for
    1. rendering on the chart in the dashboard
    2. Used for future purooses ike suhoor wrapped e.t.C
    3. 'this value renew in the database of course, everyday
    example for today if i say that iwant to fast:
    it will be true, and once it's 15 minutes to the time for suhoor, gotten from the fecth fatsimg times api ()
    the app will wake them upthis 15 minutes is a default value of course, it can be changed by the group admin.
    The group admin of any group can change the time notice of wakeing up for suhoor each day.
    now as for the waking up, each user will:
    after being buzzed of course, will click on the im awake button
    note that this feature can only work in the capacitor android app of course, we need to integrate alarm that can work 
    from the capacitor appand actually ring put of the phone
    when they wake up, this value and the date of course is all sent to the database(the database must take a lot of values
    of course)
    and each group members can see those that have woken up and those that havent
    now in each group
    the user can leave a specific location
    incase the person's phoen is switched off

    note that this capacitor app must work without an internet connection.

    Also note that this buzz alarm cant be snoozeed and will comeagain 5 minutes after the person is awake just to check if the personson is 
    truely awake.

    so basically , the flexibility of the capacitor app in mobile is that 
    it can sound alarms, give notifications, i mean real notifications
    suhorr want to have access to run in thr background e.t.c
    and buzz alarms, when your friends in the group are trying to wake you up
    in the end, the group details page is propaply going to be a bit more complex than that
    maybe in pwa of maybe in desktop too



2. As for the mobile app, when i installed the app from the chrome website

    I think it instaleled a pwa even to my android phoneso that means that we need to remove the pwa feature completely and 
    and make the capacitor app work on both android and ios
    leave the useNative.js file as it is.

3. Proceed with this plan
    keeping in mind you afre to go on with thius changes alone
    not any major chanmge elewhere in my app
    nbote what i said about a lot of information in my db
    use taht to 
    1. add another graph line to my dashboard
    2. create me a settings page, different setting for this kind of app(you'll see how i created fssting dua and other pages)
    3. Update the features section(texts only
    4. and how it works section(text only) in my landing page to match the new way that suhoor works

    just add or remove some texts in the about page too
    tecxts only please
    texts only


4. User should't be able to create an account with a 'fake ' email:
    i.e an email taht doesnot exist
    currently user is able to do this and is being navigated to the dashboard


5. The group name in wake-up tracker can be edited to be an empty string after creation
    this shouldnt be so


6. Find a partner and register for the hackathon

7. The Figma Pitch deck presentation files

8. Use the app to wake up for suhoor together with Alfa fawaz.

9. The downloadapp section in my lander shows clealry that i'm trying to install a pwa
it shows if its not already installed
and dispappers if the person already has the app
this shouldnt be the case it
should instead do like tyhat for my capacitor app


10. The activity box in the dashboard should immediately adapt to this changes if required

11. On going to the dashboard(if a  users account is already verified, it firsly load the verificationbanner for about half a second)
the same is for the peofile page , it firstly brings 'not verifired' then verified, if the user was actually verified
same thing is for the lander of the app in app.jsx, for  anative app, it firstly brings the landing page for about 0.5s
