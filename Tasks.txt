1.  Wake up flow for suhoor:

    A day before, a person is propmted on the group pageeeee if they would like to fast tomorrow or not
    if yes: it will show to all group memebers that this person wants to fast tomorrowIf not: it will show to all group memebersbers of  agroup
    that this person does not want to fast tomorrow
    If a person doesn't say anything about this, i.e say if they want to fast tomorrow or not(it will automatically
    set to true on the database, subsequently, all this fasts that theya re fasting will bw stored on the db,
    and used for
    1. rendering on the chart in the dashboard
    2. Used for future purooses ike suhoor wrapped e.t.C
    3. 'this value renew in the database of course, everyday
    example for today if i say that iwant to fast:
    it will be true, and once it's 15 minutes to the time for suhoor, gotten from the fecth fatsimg times api ()
    the app will wake them upthis 15 minutes is a default value of course, it can be changed by the group admin.
    The group admin of any group can change the time notice of wakeing up for suhoor each day.
    now as for the waking up, each user will:
    after being buzzed of course, will click on the im awake button
    note that this feature can only work in the capacitor android app of course, we need to integrate alarm that can work 
    from the capacitor appand actually ring put of the phone
    when they wake up, this value and the date of course is all sent to the database(the database must take a lot of values
    of course)
    and each group members can see those that have woken up and those that havent
    now in each group
    the user can leave a specific location
    incase the person's phoen is switched off

    note that this capacitor app must work without an internet connection.

    Also note that this buzz alarm cant be snoozeed and will comeagain 5 minutes after the person is awake just to check if the personson is 
    truely awake.

    so basically , the flexibility of the capacitor app in mobile is that 
    it can sound alarms, give notifications, i mean real notifications
    suhorr want to have access to run in thr background e.t.c
    and buzz alarms, when your friends in the group are trying to wake you up
    in the end, the group details page is propaply going to be a bit more complex than that
    maybe in pwa of maybe in desktop too



2. As for the mobile app, when i installed the app from the chrome website

    I think it instaleled a pwa even to my android phoneso that means that we need to remove the pwa feature completely and 
    and make the capacitor app work on both android and ios
    leave the useNative.js file as it is.

3. Proceed with this plan
    keeping in mind you afre to go on with thius changes alone
    not any major chanmge elewhere in my app
    nbote what i said about a lot of information in my db
    use taht to 
    1. add another graph line to my dashboard
    2. create me a settings page, different setting for this kind of app(you'll see how i created fssting dua and other pages)
    3. Update the features section(texts only
    4. and how it works section(text only) in my landing page to match the new way that suhoor works

    just add or remove some texts in the about page too
    tecxts only please
    texts only


4. User should't be able to create an account with a 'fake ' email:
    i.e an email taht doesnot exist
    currently user is able to do this and is being navigated to the dashboard


5. The group name in wake-up tracker can be edited to be an empty string after creation
    this shouldnt be so


6. Find a partner and register for the hackathon

7. The Figma Pitch deck presentation files

8. Use the app to wake up for suhoor together with Alfa fawaz.

9. The downloadapp section in my lander shows clealry that i'm trying to install a pwa
it shows if its not already installed
and dispappers if the person already has the app
this shouldnt be the case it
should instead do like tyhat for my capacitor app


10. The activity box in the dashboard should immediately adapt to this changes if required

11. On going to the dashboard(if a  users account is already verified, it firsly load the verificationbanner for about half a second)
the same is for the peofile page , it firstly brings 'not verifired' then verified, if the user was actually verified
same thing is for the lander of the app in app.jsx, for  anative app, it firstly brings the landing page for about 0.5s
