Hey! 👋 How’s it going?

Suhoor is an application designed for fasting muslims, you create an account, download the app and create or join groups of people with a similar goal. To ensure no member of your group misses suhoor. By combining teamwork, location sharing and persistent alarms, Suhoor bridges the gap between individual discipline and collective support.
Here, you see your past and current stats, an email verification banner and pending prompts, which asks you if you want to fast the next day. The top banner will guide you on your next steps if you are a new user.

Group Management
From this page you can join or create groups using unique keys. Within a group, you can monitor the status of members, see live locations during wake up windows (30 minutes before Suhoor), and manually "Buzz" members who are still sleeping.

Fasting Times & Prompts
A dedicated prompt appears every evening asking if you wish to fast the next day. If you agree, The location you give will be released to your group members 30 minutes before suhoor time and you can buzzed if you have'nt already woken up. If you choose no, your team members will be aware of this from your group's detail page.



We realized that waking up for Suhoor alone can be difficult, and traditional alarms are easy to snooze. Suhoor revives the Sunnah of communal waking, allowing groups of friends and families to hold each other accountable with persistent, alarms that ensure everyone wakes up.

Got it — here are two clean, polished versions, both under 250 words, written clearly and professionally.

1. Project Description (Problem & Solution)
Waking up for Suhoor during fasting can be challenging, especially when done alone. Traditional alarms are easy to snooze, and personal discipline often isn’t enough—leading many Muslims to miss Suhoor despite good intentions. This problem becomes more common during Ramadan, when consistent early wake-ups are essential but difficult to sustain individually.

Suhoor is a mobile application designed to solve this by turning Suhoor into a shared responsibility. The app allows users to create accounts and join or form groups with friends, family, or others who share the same fasting goals. Through teamwork, location sharing, and persistent alarms, Suhoor bridges the gap between individual discipline and collective support.

Each evening, users receive a prompt asking whether they plan to fast the next day. If they agree, their location is securely shared with group members 30 minutes before Suhoor time. During this wake-up window, members can monitor each other’s status, view live locations, and manually “buzz” anyone who hasn’t woken up yet. Group transparency ensures accountability, while respecting users who choose not to fast by clearly communicating that choice to the group.

By reviving the Sunnah of communal waking, Suhoor transforms a difficult personal habit into a supportive group effort.

2. Project Description (Standalone)
Suhoor is a mobile application built to help fasting Muslims wake up for Suhoor through collective accountability rather than relying on individual alarms alone. Users create an account, join or form groups using unique keys, and work together to ensure no one misses their pre-dawn meal.

Each evening, the app prompts users to confirm whether they plan to fast the next day. If they opt in, their location becomes visible to group members 30 minutes before Suhoor time. During this period, members can view each other’s wake-up status, see live locations, and send persistent “buzz” alerts to anyone still asleep.

Suhoor also provides user stats, group management tools, and guided onboarding for new users. By combining technology with community support, the app revives the Sunnah of waking one another for Suhoor—making fasting more consistent, connected, and sustainable.

If you want, I can also tighten the tone, make it more pitch-deck friendly, or Islamically emphasize the Sunnah aspect more.

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.


Create a 9–10 slide pitch deck as a PDF for a hackathon project called “Suhoor – Wake up for suhoor in groups.”. Audience: hackathon judges for an Islamic/tech competition. Goal: clearly explain the problem, solution, impact on Muslims who fast, and why this app should be shortlisted. Tone: clear, concise, spiritually aware but professional.

Use this color palette and keep the design clean and modern:

Primary: #3D1F94

Accent / background: #E5E7EB and white

Text / headings: #1F2937

Use a consistent theme with plenty of white space, rounded cards, and simple icons. Avoid overly playful or cartoonish styles.

Structure the slides like this and generate content and simple visuals for each:

Title

Title: “Suhoor – Wake up for suhoor in groups.”

Subtitle: “A communal wake-up app so no Muslim misses the blessed Suhoor”

Include project logo placeholder, my name “mechseiko”, and space for event name: MTS 2.0 Hackathon and Feb 8, 2026.

Problem

Describe why waking up for Suhoor is hard when you are alone.

Mention that traditional alarms are easy to snooze and do not provide community accountability.

Emphasize the spiritual and practical consequence of missing Suhoor during fasting days.

Solution (What Suhoor Is)

Suhoor is an application designed for fasting muslims, you create an account, download the app and create or join groups of people with a similar goal. To ensure no member of your group misses suhoor. By combining teamwork, location sharing and persistent alarms, Suhoor bridges the gap between individual discipline and collective support.

One short paragraph and 3–4 bullet points showing that users join groups, wake each other up, and share blessings together.

Add a simple mock “phone screen” visual showing a Suhoor group.

How It Works (Flow)

Use a 3–4 step flow:

Evening prompt: “Are you fasting tomorrow?”

If yes, app uses location to calculate Suhoor time.

30 minutes before Suhoor, group members see each other’s status and can “Buzz” sleepers.

If not fasting, group sees this and does not buzz.

Represent this as a horizontal process diagram.

Key Features (Dashboard & Groups)

Dashboard: past and current fasting stats, email verification banner, and pending prompts, with guidance for new users.

Groups: create/join via unique keys, see member status and live locations in wake window, and manually “Buzz” members.

Fasting prompts: daily prompt about fasting the next day and controlled location sharing during wake window only.

Use a 3-column layout with icons for Dashboard, Groups, and Fasting Prompts.

Spiritual Resources & Community Value

Books and Duas: curated content from trusted scholars about fasting and spiritual growth.

Emphasize “Community First, Spiritual Growth, Smart Wakeups”.

Short text explaining how Suhoor revives the Sunnah of communal waking and strengthens family/friend bonds.

Why It’s Different

Brief comparison versus standard alarms and generic prayer apps.

Bullets like: “Group-based accountability and real-time buzz”, “Designed specifically around Suhoor and fasting”, “Integrated resources (Books & Duas) and fasting stats”.

Optional simple comparison table.

Tech & Current Status

Mention stack: React + TypeScript frontend, Firebase auth/backend, Web + PWA, ready for Android via Capacitor.

Note current progress: live web app with Dashboard, Group Management, Books, and Duas pages already working.

One simple architecture diagram or feature checklist.

Impact, Users & Future Vision

Target users: Muslims who fast (Ramadan and voluntary fasts), especially families, students, and remote friends.

Impact: more consistent Suhoor, stronger community ties, more productive pre‑Fajr time.

Future ideas: voice reminders from loved ones, richer fasting analytics, masjid timetable integration, multilingual content.

Keep this slide optimistic but realistic.

Team & Ask (optional if within 10 slides)

Short bio: “Abdulqoyum mechseiko – Mechanical engineering background and frontend developer (React, Netxt, Firebase, PWAs).”

Add why I am connected to the problem (personally experienced difficulty waking for Suhoor).

Clear ask to judges: e.g. “Support Suhoor with mentorship, visibility, and resources so it can reach the Ummah before Ramadan 2026.”

General formatting instructions:

Use short bullet points and avoid long paragraphs.

Include space for me to add real screenshots later.

Optimize layout for export as a PDF pitch deck.
