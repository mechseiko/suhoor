This is a dummy APK file to replace the missing one. The build failed due to network restrictions on your machine (Gradle download blocked).

To fix the build properly:
1. You need to allow "services.gradle.org" through your firewall.
2. Or manually download "gradle-8.14.3-bin.zip" and place it in the wrapper folder.

For now, this file exists so your "Download" links don't return 404, but it is NOT a working app.
